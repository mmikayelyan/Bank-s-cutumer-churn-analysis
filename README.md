# Bank-s-cutumer-churn-analysis
This repository contains a churn analysis of XYZ Bank's credit card services, providing insights into customer attrition factors and recommendations for reducing churn.

## Summary
This report presents a customer churn analysis conducted on XYZ Bank's credit card services. The objective was to identify the main reasons for customer attrition and provide recommendations to mitigate churn. The findings of the analysis were derived through data cleaning, summary statistics, feature distribution analysis, and cross-correlation analysis.

## Context
XYZ Bank has observed a growing number of customers leaving its credit card services and aims to understand the underlying causes behind this churn. The dataset used for analysis consisted of both existing customers (84.3%) and attrited customers (15.7%). To gain insights, the data was initially examined for quality, and necessary cleaning and transformations were performed. The subsequent steps included analyzing feature distributions and conducting a cross-correlation analysis to explore relationships between different features.

## Results
The analysis yielded the following key conclusions:

- Customers with lower avg. utilization ratios have higher churn rates.
- Customers who were contacted less in the last 12 months have lower churn rates.
- Customers with more bank products have lower churn rates.
- Higher card categories have higher churn rates (Platinum: 25%, Gold: 18%).
- Customers with higher education levels have the highest churn rates.

## Recommendation
Based on the above conclusions, the following recommendations are provided:

- Encourage increased card usage for customers with low utilization ratios.
- Analyze contact methods and reasons for deeper insights.
- Promote and market additional bank products to existing customers.
- Analyze factors specific to different card categories to understand churn patterns.
- Analyze acquisition costs, methods, and features across different education levels.

Finally, an analysis of the main reasons for churning, external factors such as competitors (e.g. new entrants, new offerings), and the overall macroeconomic environment (e.g. interest rates, unemployment) potentially impacting the churn rate would enrich the analysis.
